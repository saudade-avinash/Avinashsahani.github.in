        <p> Hey! i am Avinash sahani. What should i tell about me huh?
            we have so far looked at what caste does to politics . 
            but does not mean that there is only a one way relation 
            between caste and politics. poliitics too influences 
            the caste system nd caste identities by bringing them into the politicl arena
            thus it is not politics that gets caste ridden it is the caste that gets politicised this takes sveral forms 
            each caste group  tries to become bigger by corporating whithine it neighbouring caste or sub caste which erliear excuded fprm it 
            varios caste are group are required to enter into a coilation governmant with other caste or communities and thus enter into a dialogue and nagotition.
